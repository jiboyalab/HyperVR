# HyperVR: a hybrid deep ensemble learning approach for simultaneously predicting virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes
To better simultaneous predict VFs and ARGs, we propose a hybrid deep ensemble learning approach called HyperVR. By considering both best hit scores and statistical gene sequence patterns, HyperVR combines classical machine learning and deep learning to simultaneously and accurately predict VFs, ARGs and negative genes (neither VFs nor ARGs). This repository contains codes and datas for HyperVR model.
